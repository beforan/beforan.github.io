# Final Fantasy X Restricted

The aim of this resource is to provide suggestions for enforcing restrictions on a play through of a Final Fantasy game, in order to make replays more interesting by forcing you to play the game differently than you might otherwise.

**It is assumed this will be used for *replaying* the games, and so each gameâ€™s section is *not* spoiler safe!**

## Expert Sphere Grid
This is the obvious starting point for making any version of the game since the original Japanese release more interesting.

Mess up your characters. Make Lulu a tank. Please, it's the best!

## Weapon / Armour ability restrictions
Disallow yourself some of the easier abilities in the game.

For example, *Stonetouch* and *Deathtouch* make things exceptionally easy, so ban them.
