# Final Fantasy IX Restricted

The aim of this resource is to provide suggestions for enforcing restrictions on a play through of a Final Fantasy game, in order to make replays more interesting by forcing you to play the game differently than you might otherwise.

**It is assumed this will be used for *replaying* the games, and so each gameâ€™s section is *not* spoiler safe!**


## Level 1 Run
From [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/3h79gc/what_nonstandard_challenges_do_you_like/cu556ok)

The gist of this is to flee from random encounters, and only fight bosses, therefore never actually levelling.

This works because:

- Bosses are required to beat to continue the game
- Zidane can always allow fleeing from random encounters
- Bosses give no EXP; only AP

There are some further tips and strategies to be had from [this FAQ](http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/197338-final-fantasy-ix/faqs/19867), if you're doing this.
