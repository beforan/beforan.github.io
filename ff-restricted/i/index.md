# Final Fantasy I Restricted

The aim of this resource is to provide suggestions for enforcing restrictions on a play through of a Final Fantasy game, in order to make replays more interesting by forcing you to play the game differently than you might otherwise.

**It is assumed this will be used for *replaying* the games, and so each gameâ€™s section is *not* spoiler safe!**

## Job restrictions

### Classic Four Job Fiesta
Randomly roll the jobs you get, repeats are allowed.

## Additional Modifiers

### No upgrades
No you can't turn your `White Mage` into a `White Wizard`. or upgrade *any* of your four jobs.
