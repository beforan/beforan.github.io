# Final Fantasy VIII Restricted

The aim of this resource is to provide suggestions for enforcing restrictions on a play through of a Final Fantasy game, in order to make replays more interesting by forcing you to play the game differently than you might otherwise.

**It is assumed this will be used for *replaying* the games, and so each gameâ€™s section is *not* spoiler safe!**

## Command Restrictions
Due to the nature of FF VIII's battle system, these and junctioning are the bread and butter of restricting the game.

### Magic Only
