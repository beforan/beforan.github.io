# Final Fantasy Restricted

Welcome to **Final Fantasy Restricted**.

The aim of this resource is to provide suggestions for enforcing restrictions on a play through of a Final Fantasy game,
in order to make replays more interesting by forcing you to play the game differently than you might otherwise.

**It is assumed this will be used for *replaying* the games, and so each game's section is *not* spoiler safe!**

Not all games have ideas yet, some have a few ideas that need writing up more fully.

Many ideas have been sourced from [/r/FinalFantasy](https://reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy) threads, such as the following:
