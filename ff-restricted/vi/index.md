# Final Fantasy VI Restricted

The aim of this resource is to provide suggestions for enforcing restrictions on a play through of a Final Fantasy game, in order to make replays more interesting by forcing you to play the game differently than you might otherwise.

**It is assumed this will be used for *replaying* the games, and so each gameâ€™s section is *not* spoiler safe!**


## Permadeath
From [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/3h79gc/what_nonstandard_challenges_do_you_like/cu5hw92)

> I did a permadeath FFVI run recently, just because I hadn't played the game in a while and wanted to add a handicap. It was both one of the most harrowing and one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, though it does make the final Kefka battle difficult to handle, since it forces in the majority of your party and if you have more than a few dead, it becomes difficult to leave them out.
