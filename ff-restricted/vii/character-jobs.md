# Suggested Character job assignments

## Cloud
> Cloud's stats are well rounded and he is among the characters with the highest values in every stat, notably Strength and Magic. His lowest stat is his Speed, which is still about average.
- `Knight`
- `Mystic Knight` (original job role)
- Optionally `Paladin` (makes white magic a bit easier)
- Optionally `Dark Knight` (gives earlier game black magic)

## Barret
> Barret has high HP and Defense, but poor Magical Attack and Magical Defense.
- `Ranger` (Gunner was original job role)
- `Blue Mage` (`Gun Mage`)

## Tifa
> her physical stats are better than her magic stats. She has lower HP growth than other characters, but her Strength growth gives her the second highest potential Strength of any character (second only to Cloud).
- `Monk` (original job role)

## Vincent
> He is one of the best magic users, his Magic being second to Aeris and Cloud, and tied with Cait Sith, while his max MP is second only to Aeris. Vincent has the least HP at level 99 of all characters, and possesses only marginally more Strength than Aeris. Along with Cait Sith, Vincent has the least Vitality at the highest levels, and his Dexterity is average. He has the highest Spirit rating, along with Butt, Aeris, and Cait Sith. 
- `Black Mage`
- `Summoner`
- `Mimic`

While his original job role is never clear (although may have been `Chemist`), these fit him due to stats (high magic) and thematically due to Chaos / Omega / Protomateria etc.

## Yuffie
> While she is below average on the main stats, she has high Dexterity and has the best Luck.
- `Thief`
- `Ninja` (Original job role)
- `Samurai`
- `Chemist` (**Rikku** gives precedent for `Chemist` merging with `Thief`)

## Cait Sith
> Cait Sith's stats are lower than those of most characters', although his high magic and Spirit stats makes him useful for a mage.
- `Gambler` (Obvious influence - **Setzer** Limit Breaks etc)
- `Beastmaster` (Original job role)
- White Mage (Cait Sith #2)

`White Mage` works here because of stats (which `Gambler` and `Beastmaster`, the more thematic jobs, don't really take advantage of. Also, the timing of **#2** is perfect to replace **Aeris** as `White Mage`. Also the Mog is white.

## Cid
> He has high defensive stats, but low Magic stats and MP.
- `Dragoon`
- `Blue Mage` (**Kimahri** sets the precedent for combining these two jobs)

## Aeris
> Aeris is lacking in physical stats, but makes up for it with her high magical stats.
- `White Mage`
- `Summoner`

Her original job role was essentially `Geomancer` but no materia abilities really fit that job. These fit her thematically, and combining `White Mage` and `Summoner` is a long standing tradition (notably FF IX does it twice!)

## Red XIII
> Red XIII is a well-rounded character good at both physical attacks and casting magic.
- `Red Mage`

Not just because of the "Red" in his name, the stats support balanced physical and magic use. This provides early game (pre-Vincent) black magic access.
