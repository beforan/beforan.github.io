# Final Fantasy VII Restricted

The aim of this resource is to provide suggestions for enforcing restrictions on a play through of a Final Fantasy game, in order to make replays more interesting by forcing you to play the game differently than you might otherwise.

**It is assumed this will be used for *replaying* the games, and so each gameâ€™s section is *not* spoiler safe!**

The Final Fantasy VII Restrictions were originally sourced from 
[this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/3ff915/ffvii_restricted_replay_making_it_interesting/)

## Restrictions

- [Character Mix-up](#character-mix-up)
- [Job Based](#job-based)
- [No Items](#no-items)
- [Materia Restrictions](#materia-restrictions)
- [Solo](#solo)
- [Gear Restrictions](#gear-restrictions)
- [Cait Sith Run](#cait-sith-run)
- [Mods](#mods)

### Character Mix-up
The simplest way to make a replay more interesting 
is to use different characters than you did last time, wherever you have a choice.

- Be sure to get **Yuffie** and **Vincent** if you missed them last time!
- Be sure to try and unlock as many Limit Breaks as possible, 
since these are one of the main character-defining things about the game, 
given Materia can customise abilities
- Use the characters you thought were rubbish last time - I bet they're actually pretty good!

### Job Based
Most of the characters in Final Fantasy VII do map to classic Job roles, 
at least in character and attributes, if not in abilities due to the Materia system.

The idea of this restriction is to only allow each character to equip
materia applicable to their assigned class.

There are different ways you can create job roles by restricting materia.
Here are some suggested setups:

- [Cait Sith Run Jobs](cait-sith/jobs-materia)
- [FF-Restricted Jobs](jobs-materia)

You can assign whichever jobs you like to whichever characters (or choose to do it randomly!)
but the following table contains job suggestions which cover all the materia in the game
and should make for a fairly balanced play.

The job assignments here are based on the Character's stats,
their originally intended roles,
and what we know about their characters now (thematically).

Character | Job | Notes
:--------:|-----|:-----
**Cloud** | [`Knight`], [`Mystic Knight`] | Optionally add [`Paladin`], [`Dark Knight`]
**Barret** | [`Ranger`], [`Blue Mage`] |
**Tifa** | [`Monk`] |
**Aeris** | [`White Mage`], [`Summoner`] |
**Red XIII** | [`Red Mage`] | Optionally [`Mimic`]
**Yuffie** | [`Thief`], [`Ninja`], [`Samurai`] | Optionally add [`Chemist`] (with or without magic)
**Cait Sith** | [`Gambler`], [`Beastmaster`] | [`White Mage`] when **#2** comes along (to replace **Aeris**)
**Vincent** | [`Black Mage`], [`Summoner`] | Optionally [`Mimic`]
**Cid** | [`Dragoon`], [`Blue Mage`] |

- [This page](character-jobs) covers why each Character was assigned their job roles.

Notes:

- Dual-classing is allowed, to gain ability coverage
  - Try to theme this - e.g. `White Mage` and `Summoner` is a traditional combination; `Dragoon` and `Black Mage` is not
- Don't double up on classes:
  - One character may have more than one class
  - One class generally shouldn't be used by more than one character
- Some classes may need to be transferrable / doubled up by necessity due to permanent loss of **Aeris**.
  - Temporary loss of characters (**Cloud**, **Tifa**) or forced party (mostly early in the game) 
  does not allow transferring or doubling up - dealing with that is part of the point of the restriction

[`Knight`]: jobs-materia#knight
[`Mystic Knight`]: jobs-materia#mystic-knight
[`Paladin`]: jobs-materia#paladin
[`Dark Knight`]: jobs-materia#dark-knight
[`Ranger`]: jobs-materia#ranger
[`Blue Mage`]: jobs-materia#blue-mage
[`Monk`]: jobs-materia#monk
[`White Mage`]: jobs-materia#white-mage
[`Summoner`]: jobs-materia#summoner
[`Red Mage`]: jobs-materia#red-mage
[`Mimic`]: jobs-materia#mimic
[`Thief`]: jobs-materia#thief
[`Ninja`]: jobs-materia#ninja
[`Samurai`]: jobs-materia#samurai
[`Chemist`]: jobs-materia#chemist
[`Gambler`]: jobs-materia#gambler
[`Beastmaster`]: jobs-materia#beastmaster
[`Black Mage`]: jobs-materia#black-mage
[`Dragoon`]: jobs-materia#dragoon

### No items
Exactly what it says on the tin: No item usage allowed.

This means:

- No *Tent* - inns only.
- No curative items - magic only.
- No *Ether* - inns only.
- No permanent stat boosts from items over the course of the game (e.g. *Mind Source*).
- Seriously, no items.

This turns the game primarily into MP resource management, 
since MP keeps your HP up and statuses off, 
and only inns can keep your MP up, so you live from inn to inn.

Have fun!

### Materia Restrictions
There are various ways you can restrict Materia usage to make the game more interesting. Here are some suggested themes.

#### No Materia
None at all. Items all the way for healing, damaging groups of enemies (*Deadly Bolt* etc.)...

#### Items only
This makes for a better items-based game, as it allows some (primarily Command) materia, 
such as *Steal*, *Morph* etc, which are really about items.

Allow only:

- *Steal*
- *X-Item*
- Optionally *Throw* (Items only, not Gil)

#### Colour coded
Only allow Materia of a certain colour, or colours

- *Independent* (Purple) can make for an easier magic-less game as you still get *HP Plus* and similar
- *Command* (Yellow) can make for a good magic-less game
- *Support* (Blue) exists to make the game easier (providing *All* and *QuadraMagic* and such)
- *Magic* (Green)
- *Summon* (Red)

### Solo
Apart from when the game forces you to have more, use a party of only 1 (one) character.

### Gear Restrictions
Never replace your gear. There are varying degrees of this:

- Never replace Weapons
  - Limited Materia slots on weapons
  - Limited Attack Power
  - Limited Hit%
  - Armour can be changed to gain Defence and Materia slots
  - Accessories can be changed
- Never equip new Armour
  - Character must use the Armour they start with, even if it's nothing
  - Limited Materia slots on armour
  - Limited Defence
  - Weapons can be changed to gain Attack Power, Hit% and Materia slots
  - Accessories can be changed
- Never replace Armour
  - As above, except that if the character starts with no armour, 
  they are allowed to equip one piece, and then use that for the rest of the game.
  - Up to you when you get and equip their armour.
- No Accessories
  - Nobody can use any Accessories ever.
- Never replace Accessories
  - Each character can only use the first accessory they equip.
  - Up to you when and what you equip.
- Only change accessories
  - Combine Never replace Weapons, and Never replace Armour (or Never equip new Armour)
- Never replace anything
  - Combine Never replace Weapons, Never replace Armour (or Never equipe new Armour) and Never replace Accessories
- No gear
  - God knows if this is possible, but FFVII naked run.
  - Can't equip anything, Attack Power, Hit%, Def, MDef - everything is based on your level alone
  - You can never have any Materia, as you have no slots.

## Cait Sith Run
Developed by [/u/IISuperSlothII](https://reddit.com/u/IISuperSlothII).

This takes some of the concepts discussed above and introduces a level of randomness, so taht you don't pick the restrictions yourself.

[The rules](https://i.imgur.com/sVj0jsQ.jpg) are detailed below:

- Every character is assigned a random class/job when they first join the party
  - You can use whatever class system you like for this
    - [Cait Sith Run Jobs](cait-sith/jobs-materia) ([randomiser](http://www.classtools.net/random-name-picker/61_cNdfBk))
    - [FF-Restricted Jobs](jobs-materia)
    - Something of your own design
  - Once a class is assigned, remove it from the random pool
- 5 modifiers are applied throughout the game ([randomiser](http://www.classtools.net/random-name-picker/95_DVmJP6))
  - Once a modifier is applied, remove it from the random pool
  - Apply modifiers at the following times:
    - Start of the game
    - Entering Gold Saucer for the first time
    - Start of Disc 2
    - Acquiring the Highwind
    - Start of Disc 3
- Once you have more than 3 characters, party composition is [randomised](http://www.classtools.net/random-name-picker/83_MFYghj)
  - Roll for current party:
    - Whenever a character joins the group
    - Whenever a character leaves the group
    - At the start of Disc 2
    - At the start of Disc 3
  

## Mods
The modern PC version of the game allows you to use mods to affect the gameplay, 
providing any number of increased difficulty or different mechanics based runs.

Here are some interesting mods to achieve that:

- [Tifa's Bootleg](http://forums.qhimm.com/?topic=13212.0)
- [FFVII HardType](http://www.insanedifficulty.com/board/index.php?/files/file/63-final-fantasy-vii-hard-type/) from the Insane Difficulty forums
