# Final Fantasy VII Restricted

The aim of this resource is to provide suggestions for enforcing restrictions on a play through of a Final Fantasy game, in order to make replays more interesting by forcing you to play the game differently than you might otherwise.

**It is assumed this will be used for *replaying* the games, and so each gameâ€™s section is *not* spoiler safe!**

The Final Fantasy VII Restrictions were originally sourced from 
[this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/3ff915/ffvii_restricted_replay_making_it_interesting/)

## A few simple tips
- **Aeris** starts in the back row by default, which makes her physical 
attack appear lower than it really is if you don't notice
- Most (all?) of Barrett and Yuffie's weapons are long range, 
so stick them in the back row to "increase" their defense without a penalty to physical attack


## Restrictions

- [Character Mix-up](#character-mix-up)
- [Class Based](#class-based)
- [No Items](#no-items)
- [Materia Restrictions](#materia-restrictions)
- [Solo](#solo)
- [Gear Restrictions](#gear-restrictions)
- [Mods](#mods)

### Character Mix-up
The simplest way to make a replay more interesting 
is to use different characters than you did last time, wherever you have a choice.

- Be sure to get **Yuffie** and **Vincent** if you missed them last time!
- Be sure to try and unlock as many Limit Breaks as possible, 
since these are one of the main character-defining things about the game, 
given Materia can customise abilities
- Use the characters you thought were rubbish last time - I bet they're actually pretty good!

### Class Based
Most of the characters in Final Fantasy VII do map to classic Class or Job roles, 
at least in character and attributes, if not in abilities due to the Materia system.

The idea of this restriction is to only allow each character to equip materia applicable to their assigned class.

Here are some suggested class assignments, with links to pages describing suggested materia restrictions.

Character | Class
:--------:|:-----
Cloud | `Fighter`
Barret | ?
Tifa | `Monk`
Aeris | `White Mage`, `Summoner`
Red XIII | `Red Mage`
Yuffie | `Thief`, `Ninja`
Cait Sith | `Gambler` (Lady Luck)
Vincent | ?
Cid | `Dragoon`

Other interesting class setups:

- `Black Mage`
- `Chemist`?
- `Blue Mage`

**TODO: Class pages with Materia setups**

Notes:

- Some characters have no immediately obvious class (e.g. **Barret**)
- Some desirable classes (e.g. `Black Mage`) have no immediately obvious character
- Dual-classing may be appropriate to gain coverage
  - Try to theme this - e.g. `White Mage` and `Summoner` is a traditional combination; `Dragoon` and `Black Mage` is not
- Don't double up on classes:
  - One character may have more than one class
  - One class cannot be used by more than one character
- Some classes may need to be transferrable / doubled up by necessity due to permanent loss of **Aeris**.
  - Temporary loss of characters (**Cloud**, **Tifa**) or forced party (mostly early in the game) 
  does not allow transferring or doubling up.

### No items
Exactly what it says on the tin: No item usage allowed.

This means:

- No *Tent*s - inns only.
- No curative items - magic only.
- No *Ether* - inns only.
- No permanent stat boosts from items over the course of the game (e.g. *Mind Source*).
- Seriously, no items.

This turns the game primarily into MP resource management, 
since MP keeps your HP up and statuses off, 
and only inns can keep your MP up, so you live from inn to inn.

Have fun!

### Materia Restrictions
There are various ways you can restrict Materia usage to make the game more interesting. Here are some suggested themes.

#### No Materia
None at all. Items all the way for healing, damaging groups of enemies (*Deadly Bolt* etc.)...

#### Items only
This makes for a better items-based game, as it allows some (primarily Command) materia, 
such as *Steal*, *Morph* etc, which are really about items.

Allow only:

- *Steal*
- *W-Item*
- Optionally *Throw* (Items only, not Gil)
- Optionally *Transform* (for Morph only)

#### Colour coded
Only allow Materia of a certain colour, or colours

- *Independent* (Purple) can make for an easier magic-less game as you still get *HP Plus* and similar
- *Command* (Yellow) can make for a good magic-less game
- *Support* (Blue) exists to make the game easier (providing *All* and *QuadraMagic* and such)
- *Magic* (Green)
- *Summon* (Red)

### Solo
Apart from when the game forces you to have more, use a party of only 1 (one) character.

### Gear Restrictions
Never replace your gear. There are varying degrees of this:

- Never replace Weapons
  - Limited Materia slots on weapons
  - Limited Attack Power
  - Limited Hit%
  - Armour can be changed to gain Defence and Materia slots
  - Accessories can be changed
- Never equip new Armour
  - Character must use the Armour they start with, even if it's nothing
  - Limited Materia slots on armour
  - Limited Defence
  - Weapons can be changed to gain Attack Power, Hit% and Materia slots
  - Accessories can be changed
- Never replace Armour
  - As above, except that if the character starts with no armour, 
  they are allowed to equip one piece, and then use that for the rest of the game.
  - Up to you when you get and equip their armour.
- No Accessories
  - Nobody can use any Accessories ever.
- Never replace Accessories
  - Each character can only use the first accessory they equip.
  - Up to you when and what you equip.
- Only change accessories
  - Combine Never replace Weapons, and Never replace Armour (or Never equip new Armour)
- Never replace anything
  - Combine Never replace Weapons, Never replace Armour (or Never equipe new Armour) and Never replace Accessories
- No gear
  - God knows if this is possible, but FFVII naked run.
  - Can't equip anything, Attack Power, Hit%, Def, MDef - everything is based on your level alone
  - You can never have any Materia, as you have no slots.
  
## Mods
The modern PC version of the game allows you to use mods to affect the gameplay, 
providing any number of increased difficulty or different mechanics based runs.

Here are some interesting mods to achieve that:

- [Tifa's Bootleg](http://forums.qhimm.com/?topic=13212.0)
- [FFVII HardType](http://www.insanedifficulty.com/board/index.php?/files/file/63-final-fantasy-vii-hard-type/) from the Insane Difficulty forums
