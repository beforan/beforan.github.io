# Final Fantasy XIII Restricted

The aim of this resource is to provide suggestions for enforcing restrictions on a play through of a Final Fantasy game, in order to make replays more interesting by forcing you to play the game differently than you might otherwise.

**It is assumed this will be used for *replaying* the games, and so each gameâ€™s section is *not* spoiler safe!**

## Secondary Roles only
From [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/3h79gc/what_nonstandard_challenges_do_you_like/cu4xjyt)

The way the roles are set up you only have access to one ravager(Fang) and two commandos(Hope and Vanille).

Hps pools are a lot smaller and you only get one accessory.

Party configuration is even more important and you have to take note of each characters abilities and when they learn them. Fang and Hope have great role selection, but have large flaws in some of their roles. Vanille is slow to develop. Sazh, Light, and Snow function as support only.

There are unique approaches to a lot of the bosses and you can take on every enemy in the game. The only downside is it's grindy in both exp and gil.
