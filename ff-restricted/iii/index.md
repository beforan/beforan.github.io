# Final Fantasy III Restricted

The aim of this resource is to provide suggestions for enforcing restrictions on a play through of a Final Fantasy game, in order to make replays more interesting by forcing you to play the game differently than you might otherwise.

**It is assumed this will be used for *replaying* the games, and so each gameâ€™s section is *not* spoiler safe!**

## Job restrictions

### Four Job Fiesta
Modify the FF V Four Job Fiesta concept for FF III.
