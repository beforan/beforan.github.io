# Final Fantasy XII Restricted

The aim of this resource is to provide suggestions for enforcing restrictions on a play through of a Final Fantasy game, in order to make replays more interesting by forcing you to play the game differently than you might otherwise.

**It is assumed this will be used for *replaying* the games, and so each gameâ€™s section is *not* spoiler safe!**


## License Board Restrictions

### Half License Board
From [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/3h79gc/what_nonstandard_challenges_do_you_like/cu4ygfp)

> I heard of a half license board challenge. In the standard XII, you play with only 2 characters. One gets the top half of the license board while the other gets the bottom.


## International Zodiac Job System

### No Healer
From [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/3h79gc/what_nonstandard_challenges_do_you_like/)

> basically you're not allowed to use White Mage, Red Mage, Time Mage, Monk, Archer or Knight.
